# AlgoTrading-Prototype
Algo Trading system with FastAPI backend and ReactJS frontend.

For my Algo Trading Prototype project, I developed a full-stack application that simulates algorithmic trading strategies and provides a platform to visualize and analyze market data. I started with the backend using FastAPI, which efficiently handles market data retrieval, executes trading strategies, and supports backtesting on historical datasets. The backend was designed to be modular and scalable, allowing easy addition of new strategies or integration with live trading data.The frontend was built using ReactJS, offering an interactive and responsive dashboard where users can monitor trading signals, view performance charts, and track key metrics. This separation of frontend and backend ensured smooth integration and a better user experience, while keeping the architecture organized and maintainable.
The technologies used in this project include Python and FastAPI for backend development, ReactJS for frontend, Pandas for data manipulation, and Plotly for interactive visualizations. Git and GitHub were used for version control, collaboration, and project management throughout the development process.

During development, I encountered several challenges, including integrating backend APIs with the frontend, managing large datasets efficiently for real-time analysis, and designing a user-friendly interface that is both intuitive and informative. Resolving these challenges taught me the importance of modular code design, data validation, and user-centric development, as well as debugging and performance optimization.Overall, this project strengthened my skills in full-stack development, data analysis, and visualization, while providing practical experience in building scalable, interactive, and real-world applications. It offered valuable insights into developing software solutions that are both efficient and user-friendly, and enhanced my understanding of end-to-end software development.
