# AlgoTrading-Prototype
Algo Trading system with FastAPI backend and ReactJS frontend.

For my Algo Trading Prototype project, I built a small prototype trading system that supports both backtesting and live data simulation. My first step was setting up data feeds using yfinance for historical data and a pseudo-live stream generator that replays candles in real-time. This allowed me to develop and test strategies without depending on an external broker API at the start.I implemented two simple strategies: a Moving Average Crossover (20/50 SMA) and an RSI-based momentum strategy (14-period RSI). For each, buy/sell signals are calculated and plotted on candlestick charts. I then built a lightweight backtester to simulate trades, track profit/loss, and generate an equity curve.The backend was developed in FastAPI with Python, while the frontend dashboard uses React + Plotly to visualize live charts and portfolio performance. I used SQLite to log trades and portfolio history for analysis.

One of the biggest challenges was synchronizing live data streams with backtest logic. I solved this by designing a common interface that feeds data into both modes. Another tricky part was handling portfolio accounting (exposure, PnL, cumulative returns) in a way that works consistently for multiple strategies.

Through this project I gained hands-on experience in combining data APIs, trading strategies, visualization, and backend/frontend integration. If given more time, I would like to extend this with risk management rules (stop-loss, drawdown limits) and connect to a real paper trading API such as Alpaca or Binance Testnet.
